# Multilingual Retriever for Milton H. Erickson

This project presents the development of a multilingual model used for semantic search in a specefic domain. It powers a search engine dedicated for exploring the Collected Works of Milton H. Erickson M.D. Erickson made historically significant contributions to the fields of brief therapy and hypnosis. He maintains a dedicated international following of practitioners and researchers. He and his proteges were prolific writers, and lately, efforts have picked up to digitize their works. The purpose of the search engine is to connect his audience with the material that is most relevant to their interests. It is built on OpenSearch and enhanced with a hybrid retrieval approach that combines keyword and semantic scoring. He has significant audiences in Europe, Latin America, and East Asia. With the multilingual semantic retrieval system, users may query the Collected Works in their native language. However, the highly domain-specific language used in Ericksonian teaching materials—rich in therapeutic, metaphorical, and clinical terminology—is challenging for general-purpose language models. These terms are often unseen in other contexts and interpreted inconsistently across languages, making multilingual semantic search especially noisy. This is a classic case of domain specificity, and even flagship models continue to struggle with it.



To address this, the project outlines a process for transforming a sample of multilingual Ericksonian materials into a dataset of parallel, domain-specific sentence pairs. This dataset was used to fine-tune a lightweight yet performant multilingual model tailored to the Ericksonian domain. The resulting model was then evaluated on a range of tasks to demonstrate its effectiveness. The codebase includes components for indexing, semantic retrieval, and modular query handling, making it a practical starting point for anyone building a domain-adapted document retrieval system.
